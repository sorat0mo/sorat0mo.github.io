title: New Year, Old Challenge
---

It's 2025 and we're half way through January already. Since this is my birthday, I decided to grab a new domain and start blogging again. I don't recall how many times I decided to abandon a blog previously. But I decided to make my latest one as simple as possible, I'll likely write a new post every few months.

I'm turning 25 today (yay, I guess?). Looking back, I have a lot of "What If" moments in the past. What if I was not born a boy? What if I was not so lazy to study? What if I knew Cyber Security was a thing in Secondary School? What if I didn't break up with my first love?

I wouldn't believe it 10 years ago, that I would struggle to find the one thing I love to do for the rest of my life. I believed it was either chemist or a programmer for life.

Here's hoping in 2025 I will land my dream job of being a Security Consultant, otherwise I'll drive taxi for life - at least that'll bring me more interesting stories.
